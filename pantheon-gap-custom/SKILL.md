  A skill that runs a GAP ANALYSIS & feedback review of an existing project through a multi-agent
  harness (configurable variant: the user PICKS which AI model runs the adversarial confirm step —
  including non-Anthropic models like DeepSeek, Qwen, Kimi, or a local Ollama/LM Studio model). Same
  map → probe (one agent per dimension finds gaps with file-level evidence) → adversarial confirm →
  synthesize pipeline as the pantheon-gap base, but the confirm/skeptic model is chosen per run via a
  `verifier` argument. Use when the user says "pantheon gap custom", "confirm gaps with deepseek/qwen",
  "review my project with a local model", "갭 분석 모델 골라서", "딥시크로 갭 확인", "큐원으로 프로젝트
  점검", "오픈클로처럼 리뷰 모델 선택". If no model is given it defaults to Claude (same as the
  pantheon-gap base). For the fixed presets use pantheon-gap (Claude) / pantheon-gap-x (GPT-5.6 Sol).
  To GENERATE code rather than review, use pantheon-custom. Don't use for a quick single-file glance.

# Pantheon gap-analysis harness (configurable · user-selectable confirm model)

Same `map → probe (×N dimensions) → adversarial confirm → synthesize` pipeline as the `pantheon-gap`
base, but **the user picks which AI model runs the adversarial-confirm step per run** instead of it
being fixed. `pantheon-gap` always confirms with Claude; `pantheon-gap-x` always confirms with GPT-5.6 Sol.
This skill lets you point the skeptic at **any model the `codex` CLI can reach** — DeepSeek, Qwen, Kimi,
a local Ollama/LM Studio model, or your own configured provider — as well as the Claude tiers.

Anthropic's Workflow `agent()` can only run a Claude model or an installed plugin agent, so a true
"pick any vendor" dropdown isn't built in. This skill bridges that by driving **`codex exec`** (codex is
a multi-provider router) from a thin driver agent: the external model does the judging, Claude only
relays its verdict. The confirm step is read-only — it never writes into the reviewed repo.

Configure the model once with **`/pantheon-model`** (it saves your pick to `~/.pantheon/config.json`,
OpenClaw-style, and handles API keys), or name one inline per run. The confirm model is selected with
the **`verifier`** argument, in OpenClaw-style `provider/model-id` form or a friendly alias:

| `verifier` value | adversarial confirm runs on | setup needed |
|------------------|-----------------------------|--------------|
| omitted / `claude` | Claude (session model) — same as the base | none |
| `opus` / `sonnet` / `haiku` / `fable` | that Claude tier | none |
| `codex` / `gpt` | GPT-5.6 Sol, via a shell-out to the Codex plugin's `codex-companion.mjs` | Codex plugin + `codex` login |
| `deepseek` | DeepSeek (`deepseek-chat`) | `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` |
| `qwen` | Qwen2.5-Coder via Alibaba DashScope | `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` |
| `kimi` | Kimi / Moonshot | `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` |
| `ollama:<model>` / `lmstudio:<model>` | a **local** model (e.g. `ollama:qwen2.5-coder`) | `codex` CLI + Ollama/LM Studio running, model pulled |
| `profile:<name>` | a profile from your `~/.codex/config.toml` (any provider) | `codex` CLI + that profile |
| `model:<name>` or a bare model id | that codex model id | `codex` CLI configured for it |

## Requirements
- **Workflow orchestration** — a paid plan (Pro/Max/Team/Enterprise, v2.1.154+); on Pro enable
  `/config` → Dynamic workflows. Same as `pantheon-gap`. Not on the Free tier.
- **Claude-tier verifiers (`opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku`/`fable`) need nothing extra.**
- **External / local verifiers need the `codex` CLI on PATH** — it's the router this skill drives via
  `codex exec`. Note this is the codex **binary**, *not* the Codex plugin: the plugin
  is only needed for `verifier: codex`/`gpt`. Per choice:
  - `deepseek` / `qwen` / `kimi` → the matching API-key env var must be set (`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`,
    `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY`, `MOONSHOT_API_KEY`).
  - `ollama:` / `lmstudio:` → that local server running with the model pulled (no API key, fully local).
  - `profile:` / bare model id → the provider/model defined in `~/.codex/config.toml`.
- **If the chosen verifier can't actually run** (codex missing, key unset, model unreachable), the
  driver returns a verdict marked `unavailable: true`; the harness counts it as an ABSTENTION and a
  gap with zero real verdicts is KEPT but flagged `unconfirmed` (surfaced in the report and in
  `gapsKeptUnconfirmed`, never counted in `gapsConfirmed`) rather than silently dropped; treat such
  findings as not really cross-checked.
  Check availability first (step 2); if you can't, fall back to the `pantheon-gap` base or a Claude
  tier.

## When to use
- A real project/repo you want an evidence-backed, cross-checked gap list for — before a launch, after
  an MVP, inheriting a codebase — where you want a specific model to filter the findings (a cross-vendor
  model to strip same-model confirmation bias hardest, a free local model to save cost, or a Claude tier).
- Don't use it to *write* code — that's `pantheon-custom`. Don't use it for a trivial one-file look.
  Each run costs real tokens.

## Procedure (when this skill triggers)
1. **Resolve the confirm model (the model is configured separately by `/pantheon-model`):**
   1. If the user named a model inline ("confirm with deepseek", "ollama/qwen2.5:7b로 점검"), use that —
      just this run; it doesn't change the saved default.
   2. Else **Read `~/.pantheon/config.json`** and use its `verifier`. If it also has a `providers` block,
      keep it to pass along (step 5). The default is shared with `pantheon-custom`.
   3. If there's **no config yet**, tell the user to run **`/pantheon-model`** once to pick a model (it
      lists what's available and sets up any API key), then either wait or proceed with the Claude
      default (`= the pantheon-gap base`) for this run. Don't onboard here — picking the model is
      `/pantheon-model`'s job.
   Formats: OpenClaw-style `provider/model-id` (`ollama/qwen2.5:7b`, `deepseek/deepseek-chat`, …) or an
   alias (`deepseek`, `qwen`, `kimi`, `codex`, `ollama:<m>`, `profile:<name>`).
2. **Sanity-check the confirm model can run:**
   - Claude tier → nothing to check.
   - `codex`/`gpt` → the Codex plugin's `codex-companion.mjs` exists and `codex login status` is OK.
   - Local (`ollama/…`, `lmstudio/…`) → `codex` CLI on PATH and the local server up with the model pulled.
   - Cloud (deepseek, qwen, gemini, …) → `codex` CLI on PATH and the provider's key available
     (`printenv <ENVKEY>`, or in `~/.pantheon/env` which the harness sources before codex). **If the key
     isn't set up, send the user to `/pantheon-model`** — it does the secure key setup (key goes in a
     file, never the chat). Don't collect keys here.
   If it can't run, offer a Claude tier or the `pantheon-gap` base instead of shipping an unconfirmed
   report.
3. **Pin the target.** Which project/path is being reviewed, and is there a focus (e.g. "security and
   tests only")? If unclear, ask 1 short question.
4. **Decide the parameters:**
   - `target`: an **absolute path** to the project root to audit.
   - `dimensions` (optional): an explicit list to audit; omit to let the scout pick the most relevant.
   - `focus` (optional): a dimension or area to emphasize.
   - `maxDimensions`: how many dimensions to probe (default 6).
   - `verifiers`: skeptical reviewers per finding (default 2; bump to 3 to be stricter).
   - `verifier`: the model that runs the adversarial confirm (see the table above). Omit for Claude.
5. **Run the Workflow** — **Read `pantheon-gap-class.js` in this same directory**, then pass its
   contents inline as the Workflow `script` argument. **Pass the chosen `verifier`:**
   ```
   Workflow({
     script: <contents of pantheon-gap-class.js>,
     args: { target, dimensions, focus, maxDimensions, verifiers, verifier, providers }
   })
   ```
   (`providers` = the `providers` block from `~/.pantheon/config.json` if present — `/pantheon-model`
   writes it for custom cloud providers; omit it and the built-in ~15-provider catalog still routes.
   This skill's instruction is itself the approval to call Workflow.)
6. **It runs in the background.** When the completion notice arrives, report: which dimensions were
   probed, how many gaps were found vs. confirmed by the chosen model (survived adversarial dismissal),
   the top prioritized gaps, the quick wins, and the single highest-leverage fix. **State which model
   did the confirming** (the script logs it).

## Pipeline (what the script does)
- **Map** — one scout reads the README/structure/manifests/tests/CI, names the project's stated purpose
  and maturity, and picks the dimensions worth auditing for THIS project.
- **Probe** — one Claude agent per dimension hunts for gaps (missing/incomplete/weak), each citing
  file-level evidence; high-signal findings over a long noisy list.
- **Confirm** — for each candidate gap, V skeptics **on the chosen `verifier` model** try to DISMISS it.
  For external/local models a driver runs `codex exec` (sandbox: read-only, ephemeral) and relays the
  model's structured verdict; a gap is kept only if a majority confirm it.
- **Synthesize** — a Claude judge dedups and prioritizes by impact × effort: top gaps, quick wins, and
  the highest-leverage next fix.

## Notes
- **Not a resident process.** One-shot per call, then exits — zero cost when idle.
- It **reports** gaps; it does not fix them. Hand the report to `pantheon` (or plain Opus) to act on.
- The external model does the actual judging; Claude only transports its verdict, so cross-vendor
  independence holds. Built-in `deepseek`/`qwen`/`kimi` aliases are conveniences — for full control set
  up a `profile:` in `~/.codex/config.toml`.
- Coding/agentic productivity only. Not for bypassing safety gates.
